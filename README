This script is most effectively used in combination with cron or a task scheduler (on a 15 minute interval perhaps).

You need to run: gem install win32-sapi

Linux users may wish to use the Festival package.

apt-get install festival

Modify the code to do something ala:
	system "echo foobar | festival -tts"
